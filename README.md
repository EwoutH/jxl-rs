# JPEG XL in Rust

This is an experimental, unsupported and *incomplete* reimplementation of a
JPEG XL decoder in Rust. So far, it exists more as a personal experiment from
@veluca93 than anything else.

Refer to [the main libjxl repository](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl) for
more information, including contributing instructions.
